Welcome to my website! 
I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science with a deep passion for programming language design, robotics, and rocketry.

In my free time, I enjoy working on side projects, many of which you can find on my GitHub. 
These projects range from programming experiments to more complex builds like my robotic arm. 
When I'm not coding, you can find me mountain biking or running, always looking for new ways to challenge myself.

My ultimate goal is simple: to build cool stuff.

My blog is a personal space where I document my progress, share insights about my projects, and dive into the technology that interests me. 
It's a way for me to track my journey and perhaps even inspire others who share similar interests.
Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something here that sparks your curiosity as much as these topics spark mine.
